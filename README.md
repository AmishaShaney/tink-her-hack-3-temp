### Project Description
Our project is a community-driven platform designed to support homeless and underprivileged individuals by connecting them with nearby orphanages, old age homes, and volunteer services. Users can easily add details about a person in need, and the system automatically notifies relevant organizations in the vicinity to provide assistance. With features like volunteer transportation services and real-time notifications, the platform streamlines the process of offering help, fostering collaboration between communities and support organizations to create a more inclusive and compassionate society.


### The Problem statement
Homelessness is a significant issue affecting individuals and communities worldwide. Many homeless individuals lack access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and medical care. Simultaneously, organizations and volunteers willing to assist often struggle with a lack of coordination, effective communication, and a centralized system to manage and respond to requests. The absence of a unified platform results in delayed assistance and missed opportunities to connect people in need with available resources.

### The Solution
The Shelter Management System is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between homeless individuals, volunteers, and shelters. This platform facilitates seamless collaboration and provides a structured way to address homelessness.  

Key Features:  
Case Reporting:  
   - Allows users to report homeless or underprivileged individuals who require assistance.  
   - Users can input details like location, condition, and immediate needs.

Real-Time Notifications:
   - The system notifies nearby orphanages, old age homes, and shelters for assistance.  
   - Alerts volunteers who can help with transportation and on-ground support.

Volunteer Services: 
   - Volunteers can sign up to assist in activities such as food distribution, medical support, or transporting homeless individuals to shelters.  

Shelter and Organization Management: 
   - Shelters and organizations can manage requests, review cases, and provide real-time updates on availability and assistance status.

Interactive Maps:
   - Integrated Google Maps feature for pinpointing the location of reported cases.
